    info: `Ergonomic assessments are extremely useful because they are aimed at facilitating a person’s
    work environment to fit their cognitive needs and physical structure. The discipline uses
    concepts found in biomechanics, anthropometry, design, and psychology to create a healthier
    interaction of the workspace to the person. It can promote higher efficiency and productivity
    because it helps to reduce the overall discomfort of the user interaction with the space.`,

    clinic_info: `At AOT Services, our ergonomic assessment will consist of several parts: you (i.e., the person),
    your workspace (i.e., the environment), and your job demands (i.e., occupation). This allows for
    ergonomic risk factors to be identified leading to recommendations of adaptations and equipment
    to be formed. Ergonomics truly matters and it’s important to be knowledgeable on how your
    workspace could be impacting you. Some ergonomic risk factors can be easy to identify but
    others are not as observable – that’s where OTs trained in this area come in.`,

    info: `Functional home assessments involve an occupational therapist (OT) assessing an individual’s
    ability to engage in their basic and instrumental activities of daily living (ADL), which can
    include completing a load of laundry, making the bed, food preparation, transferring in/out of
    your bathtub or bed, and dressing. OTs will take into consideration the physical and cognitive
    abilities of the person to help with determining current level of independence and need for home
    making assistance and/or equipment.`,
    
    clinic_info: `At AOT Services, we focus on ensuring safety and independence within the home environment
    in order to optimize quality of living. Our assessments are individualized and geared towards
    evaluating the unique needs of the individual. They will include standardized and non-
    standardized assessments to assist with determining home environment accessibility and barriers
    towards functional performance. We will also coordinate with vendors for installation of
    equipment needs and can provide follow-up treatment sessions for strategies to improve overall
    function.`,

    subtitle: '& Cognitive Rehabilitation',
    subject: 'an Ergonomic Assessment',
    info: `Occupational therapists (OT) experienced in concussion management are skilled at assessing the
    physical and cognitive symptoms of a concussion and analyzing their impact on daily function.
    A concussion is a mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and ultimately results in impairment of
    brain function. Thus, a person who has sustained a concussion can experience symptoms such as
    but not limited to: headaches, slower processing speed, fatigue, memory difficulties,
    concentration problems, and light and noise sensitivity. It is important to note that concussions
    are considered unique to the individual meaning a concussion management program will need to
    be tailored specifically to the injured person.`,

    clinic_info: `At AOT Services, we aim to provide meaningful goal-oriented programs that take into
    consideration the person, environment (both home and community), and occupation. Our initial
    OT assessment will consist of objective data and subjective information to gain a better
    understanding of your symptoms and functional limitations. This will establish a foundation for
    individualized intervention that targets optimal functioning. We strive to offer high quality OT
    services for concussion management by using evidence-based practice resources, expert
    consensus, analyzing research literature, as well as practicing in a holistic and client-centred
    manner. Click here to contact us about making a referral to our clinic.`,
