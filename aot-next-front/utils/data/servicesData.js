    info: `Occupational therapists (OT) experienced in concussion management are skilled at assessing the
    physical and cognitive symptoms of a concussion and analyzing their impact on daily function.
    A concussion is a mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and ultimately results in impairment of
    brain function. Thus, a person who has sustained a concussion can experience symptoms such as
    but not limited to: headaches, slower processing speed, fatigue, memory difficulties,
    concentration problems, and light and noise sensitivity. It is important to note that concussions
    are considered unique to the individual meaning a concussion management program will need to
    be tailored specifically to the injured person.`,

    clinic_info: `At AOT Services, we aim to provide meaningful goal-oriented programs that take into
    consideration the person, environment (both home and community), and occupation. Our initial
    OT assessment will consist of objective data and subjective information to gain a better

    consensus, analyzing research literature, as well as practicing in a holistic and client-centred
